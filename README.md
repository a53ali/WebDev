Assignment: Build a prototype E-commerce Website.

This website was meant to help Recreation combat the online market. Previously, it has been noted that Recreation was forced to drop some of their low-end models from the market simply because they were being consistently out-done by the cheaper alternatives that were being provided globally. By providing this new platform, we give Recreation a fighting chance against this threat.  Additionally, we note that in implementing this platform, Recreation will be entering the online market faster than most of its competitors since they at this point they are only considering but have not implemented online trading with customers.
